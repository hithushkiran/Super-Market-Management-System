## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10
- Node.js LTS and npm
- MySQL server running locally
- Google Chrome (for Selenium test)

## Configuration

### Backend configuration file

File: SupermarketAPI/appsettings.json

Key sections:

- ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection
- Jwt:Issuer
- Jwt:Audience
- Jwt:Key
- Jwt:ExpiresInMinutes

Important:

- Use your local MySQL credentials in DefaultConnection.
- Replace Jwt:Key with a strong random secret of at least 32 characters.

### Backend launch URL

File: SupermarketAPI/Properties/launchSettings.json

- Development HTTP URL: http://localhost:5224

### Frontend API URL

File: frontend/src/services/api.ts

- API base URL: http://localhost:5224/api

## Run the Project Locally

### 1) Start backend

~~~powershell
cd SupermarketAPI
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
~~~

Swagger (development):

- http://localhost:5224/swagger

### 2) Start frontend

~~~powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
~~~

Frontend app:

- http://localhost:3000

### 3) Optional Selenium smoke test

Prerequisite: backend and frontend must already be running.

~~~powershell
cd tests/selenium
npm install
npm test
~~~

## Database Notes

The application uses EF Core and also includes features that were introduced with manual MySQL setup during development.

Ensure the database contains required tables:

- Products
- Users
- Cart
- CartItems
- Orders
- OrderItems

If your local database is fresh, run migrations for EF-managed schema and execute the required SQL setup for manually introduced tables/procedures used by auth/cart/order flows.

## API Overview

### Products (public)

- GET /api/products
- GET /api/products/{id}
- GET /api/products/category/{category}
- GET /api/products/lowstock?threshold=10
- POST /api/products
- PUT /api/products/{id}
- DELETE /api/products/{id}

### Auth

- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/auth/profile (auth required)
- PUT /api/auth/profile (auth required)
- POST /api/auth/change-password (auth required)

### Cart (auth required)

- GET /api/cart
- POST /api/cart/items
- PUT /api/cart/items/{id}
- DELETE /api/cart/items/{id}
- DELETE /api/cart/clear

### Orders (auth required)

- POST /api/orders
- GET /api/orders
- GET /api/orders/{id}

## Frontend Routes

- /
- /add-product
- /edit-product/:id
- /register
- /login
- /profile
- /cart
- /checkout
- /orders
- /orders/:id

## Testing

### QA test sheet

Use this file for execution tracking:

- docs/qa-test-sheet-auth-cart-orders.md

### Manual E2E flow

Suggested verification flow:

1. Registration
2. Login
3. Profile update and password change
4. Add to cart and update cart
5. Checkout
6. Orders list and details

## Troubleshooting

### Backend cannot connect to database

- Verify MySQL is running on localhost:3306
- Verify username/password in appsettings.json
- Verify database name in connection string

### 401 Unauthorized on protected endpoints

- Login first to get JWT
- Ensure Authorization header is present as Bearer token
- Verify Jwt settings are consistent and key length is at least 32 chars

### Frontend cannot call backend

- Ensure backend is running on http://localhost:5224
- Ensure frontend API base URL matches backend URL
- Ensure CORS in Program.cs allows http://localhost:3000

### Cart update fails with product mismatch

- Current backend cart update requires the matching productId for the cart item.
- Frontend cartApi resolves this automatically before sending the update request.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit real production secrets to appsettings.json.
- Move JWT key and database credentials to environment variables or secret manager for production.
- Use HTTPS and secure cookie/token strategies in production environments.
